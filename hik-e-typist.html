Of course I have a couple of “solves” within a pretty small geographic area. However. It seems that in addition to what’s already been posted, the poem really can’t be solved because 1) the cost of verifying a correct solve is high. How many people have a “solve” but can’t check it because of cost? 2) the poem has no reasonable internal cross checks. You have absolutely no idea if you’re on the right track, other than anecdote.

I've long been a fan of mechanical keyboards and use one daily at work and home. For me, the MBP butterfly keyboard was not an "acquired" taste, more like after the first time I used it I was like "wow, this is good". I'm a touch typist that can hit over 100 wpm in a typing test, though I would estimate my "normal" typing speed is much slower, maybe around 80 WPM.

This seems to be a bit of a blight lately, people asking if they can or how to jump to be in a relationship with someone, or complaining about how it ended in disaster. Just don't do it. Learn about free will, you can't force somebody to do something they don't will without serious consequences. Dimensional jumps are for self improvement, not some gross wish fulfillment. If you feel like you need companionship to validate your existence, do not participate in dimensional jumping. 5 ноя 2017  Другая машинистка — The Other Typist.

I'm a 30 y/o male and I need to figure out my career path quick. I have done the retail thing since I was 14 and I am not dealing with the customer bullshit anymore and I need to make a livable wage. My most noteworthy experiences are 3 years management experience and 3 years at a UPS Store which gave me packing, shipping and experience handling claims. Also I did some Excel, and lots of printing, copying, notary services, office stuff like that. I have been looking since April 3 a CEO, a chairman (генеральный директор, председатель). 4 a typist, a receptionist (машинист, ресепшионист). 5 an accountant, a surveyor ( бухгалтер. Hello fellow typists, I have been enjoying this hobby for a while now, I own keyboards for approximately 2000 euro at this point. I have spent alot of time perfecting sound, looks, feel and so on. I have an urge to build more every day, but my wallet can't keep up with this. With that said I am writing this as a introduction to my keyboard building service, I have had this thought in the back of my head for a while but I have never gone through with it. I want to offer europeans. Most people know the story of Captain “Sully” Sullenberger, who ditched US Airways flight 1549 in the middle of New York’s Hudson River after birds destroyed both engines, saving the lives of everyone on board. Also well-known is the story of flight attendant Vesna Vulovic, who survived a mid-air bombing at 33,000 feet and went on to become a Serbian folk hero. These are remarkable tales of survival against the odds that stick with us through the decades—those moments when everyone lived Inspired by an earlier post by /u/NightmareNasty_ Please stop typing people by the few sentences they say on a discord server, especially if they're confident in their type (for well established reasons) and don't ask for a new typing. I can't tell you how many absolute cunts typed me (when I didn't ask for it - my type has been determined a hundred times before, letters, functions, facets, fuck-its, I don't need this all over again) from some shit I said on their discord server. 
Well.retired anyway. Throwaway to evade those who seek to identify. Some things about this series trouble me. (Apology for the spelling and punctuation.most done through voice to text) I can't think of any counter corruption unit that is staffed by uniformed officers. all counter corruption units that I have dealt with an exclusively staffed by plainclothes officers. there may also be support staff in the office in the shape of typists or analysts. I can see a detective inspector a detect. Hi! A friend of mine said this would be good place for me to post, though I can't really tell if that was an lowkey insult or she was genuinely trying to help me. Anyway, I'm Sarah, currently chillin' at uni right now (okay, not right now because it's 10pm) in York (UK, so it's Old York :)). I browsed some posts here and people seem down on the whole bullet point thing so I'll go for that! Me: Interests: post-rock music, Overwatch (PC), crappy romance novels, those Nescafe double chocolat. \ \ SOLD for \ \ Tumstump (https://imgur.com/a/rirPKgF) I bought these 9009's from a user who never even opened the box. I opened them, put them on my new keyboard for 5 minutes, decided they didn't look perfect with the gray case I have, and swapped 'em for Muted's (same set, but less beige and more gray). So, up for sale they go! The beige 6.25U spacebar's iffy at best (more on that below), but the kit has two other 6.25U spacebars included, 8 others. I hate holding down keys, it hurts a little as I have mild RSI. What I want is to be able to push shift once, and then the next key press (and just that press) will be capitalised. Essentially the shift would act as a caps-lock which disables itself after the next key press. Similarly, I also want the same functionality for my symbol layer, so say "a" is "\ " in my symbol layer, then the sequence ("layer switch" -> a -> a) will type (\ -> a). I'm currently compiling my own firmware. #On this day (April 21) in Nintendo history. Duck Hunt was released in 1984 for the NES in Japan. In this light gun shooter/sports game, developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 , take aim, and hit as many flying targets as you can! It's duck season, and your trusty hunting dog is ready to scour the open fields. Test your sharpshooting skills as your targets take flight. Be quick to knock them out of the skies, or your canine companion won't hesitate 
People who sit in an office and type all day are not skilled. Code is like music beats, re-done, re-hashed and copied/sampled. You have programs that automate everything you do, programs to find your fuck ups and the internet at your fingertips for all of your skilled, high education work. you know, to solve your problems. Time consumption for mindless work does not equate to skill at all. Masons? Those are skilled workers. Stripers? Those are skilled workers. Ironworkers? Skilled. Electri. tl;dr: lady at my work won't leave my role alone and keeps insisting I get reassigned to her shitty program while insisting that this is where I want to be - doing shitty work for her. Yeah, I know, my story hardly warrants an update, but I figure I’d just put it out there in case it’s interesting. The original story is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/bfecqo/director_at_my_work_tries_to_get_me_to_fight_with/ So, it’s been a few weeks. I thought it was all settl. Sold/Shipped to u/Pair_of_Dice for 4, Goods & Services Not sure what a fair/going price is on these. Lightly used, slight shine on wasd. I'm not a typist so they didnt see heavy use at all. Great condition. Pics incoming Sold/Shipped to u/Pair_of_Dice for 4, Goods & Services Would 0 be fair? Let me know if they go for less! Sold/Shipped to u/Pair_of_Dice for 4, Goods & Services. Recently, there was a person asking for help about RSI in one of my facebook groups, and it reminded me to write this post. I'm not saying that all of us should get a split ergo, I'm not even using my Dactyl that much anymore, and I'm also not talking about the proper touch-typist form where you must use the left index finger to hit the 'B' key. But what I want to share is a reminder, as a fellow keyboard enthusiast, that it's important to make sure that we are not damaging ourselves while. Here is a list I compiled some time ago of companies hiring newbie general transcriptionists. I hope that someone people find this list to be helpful. I personally have worked for a couple of companies on this list: Rev.com (https://rev.com/) and Scribie.com (https://scribie.com/). I wouldn't recommend the later due to slave labor wages but have included it on this list nonetheless. 1. 1-888-TYPE-IT-UP ( – Will hire inexperienced transcript. Have two real characters, plus Mules already set up and ready to go. Need help transfering stuff between the two characters, but also over to a Mule. This would also include moving Caps to a Mule too, so preferably you aren't anywhere near max Caps. Nervous to entrust so much to someone, so I'm hoping for someone with a nice high karma. If you're an approved middleman I'd be happy to pay for your services. There's a bunch to move, so you'd need to be able to basically empty your inventory. Edit: Awesome! Thanks for the Gold! Having just picked up an Oculus Go a few days ago I wanted to share my thoughts. I know people have mixed feeling about using it as a monitor replacement, and it's really not my intention to try and convert anybody to my way of doing things here, but I just wanted share some of the positive experiences I've had when working with the Oculus Go and Virtual Desktop. I previously tried to use the Rift for productivity </p>
